# Today, I will

## What? 

This was my first rails app ever, created April 2010 with pointers from [Jimmy
Kittiyachavalit](https://github.com/jimmy). 

If you ever needed to make today about _just one thing_, then this website is
for you. It's currently deployed [here](http://theonlydayistoday.com), through
  [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com).
